#Training StyleGAN2 on Colab
Yâ€™all wonâ€™t stop asking me about this so here ya go ðŸ˜‚

If it were me Iâ€™d sign up for Colab Pro ($10/month) to get a couple extra hours of training time in per session. But you crazy kids can do whatever you want.

##Mounting Google Drive
So Iâ€™m actually gonna install my entire repo directly into Google Drive. This will make the setup a little easier, but its a little strange I admit.

First, connect your Drive to Colab.
"""

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

"""##Install the repo
**Only do this for the first time ever setting this up!**

If this is your first time ever running this notebook, youâ€™ll want to install my fork of StyleGAN2 to your Drive account. Make sure you have ample space on your Drive (Iâ€™d say at least 50GB). This will install the repo and add some dependecies (like transferring from FFHQ the first time).

Every time after your first use of this notebook youâ€™ll want to skip this cell and run the cell after this.

"""##Converting your dataset
StyleGAN requires you to convert your standard jpg or png images into a new format (.tfrecords). 

Iâ€™ve seen some recommendations to run this command every time you restart your Colab machine. I think if you ahve a small-ish dataset (< 2000 images) thatâ€™s probably unnecessary.

I recommend you upload your dataset to Google Drive and copy its path from the Drive folder in Colab and paste its path in the below cell.

After the `create_from_images` argument you need to pass in two paths. The first path is where the .tfrecords files should be output (just edit the last part to have a unique name). The second path is to the directory of your images.



"""

#2nd argument is where to put your tfrecords files
#3rd should point at your image dataset

"""##Training
Note: this will require you to restart your Colab machine every 8â€“16 hours. Youâ€™ve been warned!

This library is set up to automatically find your latest .pkl file so it should keep re-training and making progress.

##Training Options
`--dataset`

This should be the name you used in the first path when converting your dataset.

`--mirror-augment`

Using this option loads some images at random mirrored horizontally (left-to-right). This might help if you have a very small dataset.

`--metrics`

METRICS DONâ€™T MATTER. Itâ€™s art! Use your eyes. Set `--metrics=None` and live your life.

If you must use metrics, you have a few options. `fid50k`, the default, uses Frechet Inception Distance score. Itâ€™s what was used in StyleGAN1 and what most people know. Itâ€™s fine for images of animals and things, but itâ€™s not great. `ppl_wend` is what StyleGAN2 prefers and claims to be more accurate. There are a bunch of other options but Iâ€™d recommend you stick with those. Note that both of these take 30â€“45minutes to run every time it runs so that cuts into your training time in Colab.

"""

!python run_training.py --num-gpus=1 --data-dir=./datasets --config=config-f --dataset=outputgan --mirror-augment=true --metrics=None

!pip3 install opensimplex

"""Once running, your training files will show up in the results folder.

#Testing the model (generating images)
The following command will generate 55 sample images from the model.

##Options
`--network`

Make sure the `--network` argument points to your .pkl file. (My preferred method is to right click on the file in the Files pane to your left and choose `Copy Path`, then paste that into the argument after the `=` sign).

`--seeds`

This allows you to choose random seeds from the model. Remember that our input to StyleGAN is a 512-dimensional array. These seeds will generate those 512 values. Each seed will generate a different, random array. The same seed value will also always generate the same random array, so we can later use it for other purposes like interpolation.

`--truncation-psi`

Truncation is a special argument of StyleGAN. Essentially values that are closer to 0 will be more real than numbers further away from 0. I generally recommend a value between `0.5` and `1.0`. `0.5` will give you pretty "realistic" results, while `1.0` is likely to give you "weirder" results.
